Hi I am a student at California State University East Bay studying Computer Engineering.  
I started coding around 2021 when I first began taking Computer Science classes in community college.  
What started as a love of video games began my journey to search more into how computers work, how to program them etc.  
Here I want to learn how to develop (and finish) my first game!
